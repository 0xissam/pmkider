# PMKID Attack Script
This Python script performs a PMKID attack on a Wi-Fi network to obtain the Pairwise Master Key ID (PMKID) hash, which can be used to crack the Wi-Fi password. The script uses the hcxdumptool and hashcat tools to capture the PMKID hash and crack it, respectively.

# Prerequisites
Linux operating system
hcxdumptool and hcxpcapngtool tools installed
hashcat tool installed
termcolor Python package installed
# Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/0xissam/pmkider.git
Change directory to the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd pmkider
Run the script:

Copy code
python3 pmkid_attack.py
Follow the prompts to enter the interface on monitor mode and the MAC address of the target access point.

Wait for the script to capture the PMKID hash and write it to a file called hash.hc22000.

When prompted, choose whether to crack the hash using hashcat. If you choose to crack the hash, the script will run hashcat with the PMKID hash file as input and the /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wordlist.
